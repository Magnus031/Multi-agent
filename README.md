# Multi-agent


> Here is my 2024_ZJU_summer_Term Multi-agent project repo.

**Please run the project with conda!** 

- Here is the example:

  - `conda create -n mylab python=3.8` TA suggests to build the conda experiment in python3.8.
  - `conda activate mylab` Here `mylab` is the  conda experiment I build.
  - `python3 ../experiment1/experiment1.py`
